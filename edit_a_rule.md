# Edit an ACT rule with Github
These are instructions to make suggested edits to an existing rule in the ACT Repository. All of your edits will be saved to a different branch, so don't worry, you are not making direct edits to the rule file. 

Your suggested edits will be used to create a pull request. Only after the pull request is approved will the changes be merged into the rule file.


***

### 1. [Go to the ACT GitHub repository rules folder](https://github.com/act-rules/act-rules.github.io/tree/develop/_rules)

### 2. Find the rule file to edit and select it.
The list is sorted alphabetically. Some rules have similar names but include the Rule ID, which is unique.

### 3. Click on Edit this file.

### 4. Edit the file.
Most of the rule is written in [markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), except the Examples which are code.

### 5. Under the Commit changes section, select "Create a new branch..." and enter a branch name for your edited file.
Changes must be reviewed so most users will not have the option to select the first radio button "Commit directly to the develop branch."

### 6. Select 'Propose changes' button to Create a Pull Request.
